### * react, mongoDB, next.js*
Little web app that allows anyone to upload and delete images.

## Structure
- `pages` contains the next.js app with API routes and react pages. All of the
images are stored on the filesystem of my ubuntu machine which is hosting the website.
The database stores the path to these files instead of storing the files themselves.
